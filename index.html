           You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone. You tellin' me people don't look at Kanye West like the glitch? I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be 'architected.' Because I sit back and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy? I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration. Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star.

I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration. Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix. I'm Walt Disney. I'm like Howard Hughes. I'm like David Stern. I'm like Steve Jobs. If anything, that's a compliment to them. I'm like Michelangelo cause I'm the new version of that. You don't think that I would be one of the characters of today's modern Bible? I understand culture. I am the nucleus. It's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That's all it is. You will believe in yourself. I'm just the espresso. I feel like a little bit, like, I'm the Braveheart of creativity. I just wanted to tell everyone I gave Sway his first TV. And he needs to remember that. I'm 10 years ahead of your mentality. But I'm a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph, make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire.
